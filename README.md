## Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The web framework used
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The CSS framework used

## Responsive Design

The page is designed to be responsive and work on all screen sizes. I used Tailwind CSS's responsive design utilities and the flexbox layout to achieve this.

## Visual Parity

I made an effort to achieve visual parity with the design as closely as possible. However, in some cases it was not possible to achieve exact visual parity due to differences in implementation between the design and the final product. In such cases, I have tried to use the most similar styles available.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
